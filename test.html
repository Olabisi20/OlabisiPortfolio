									<h2>Workflow</h2>
									<p>Testing in software development aims to identify and prevent any potential issues that may occur throughout the entire project.
                                         The ultimate aim of Quality Assurance Engineers (QAs) is to ensure that the company delivers an error-free and high-quality product that provides the best possible user experience. 
                                         There are various types of QA testing I have focused on:

										
										<ul>
										<li>Functional Testing: A simple test using Selenium, Java and JUnit to test users putting items in carts and checking cart icon to see if same items are added to carts -->
                                             <a href="https://github.com/Olabisi20/Test_amaz_carts" class="button">View Project</a></li>
										<li>Performance Testing: Performed Load and performance testing using Load Runner and VuGen to test how a system can simply handle its expected load and response time.
                                            Performance tests help confirm the reliability, stability, and availability of the product and verify if additional load is going to degrade the performance of the system.
                                        </li>
										<li>Smoke Testing: is the practice of testing fundamental and core elements of a software program in the early phases of development to identify minor issues that might delay the product’s release.
                                            They also help reveal if failures are severe enough to reject a prospective software release.
                                        </li>
							 			<li>Regression Testing: Regression testing allows testers to test an application after a change or modification has been made. By running functional and non-functional tests,
                                             it ensures that previously developed and tested software performs as expected – post bug fixes, 
                                            software enhancements or configuration changes. Ensuring that recent codes and additions are working properly improves the ability to run automation smoothly.</li>
                                        <li>Personal web Project: A web Project created final year in college --> <a href="https://github.com/Olabisi20/Web_TermProject" class="button">View Project</a></li></li>
										</ul>
